# Amazon-ASIN-JSON-Generator
This script creates a GUI application using `tkinter` to generate and display a JSON object based on a list of Amazon Standard Identification Numbers (ASINs) provided by the user. It is specifically designed to be used with the Chrome extension "Web Scraper - Free Web Scraping," which allows users to automate the extraction of data from web pages.
